## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My main goal with this project was to learn Flexbox and to add other pages to the site, including the FAQ and the about page.

Here are some examples of the code snippets:

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/normalize.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/main.css">
```
```css
header nav {
  font-size: 1.125em;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  align-items: center;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  width: 60%;
}
```

### Continued development

The project served as a great means of practicing and understanding different ways of making page layouts. It also gave me a taste of what it was like to experiment with Flexbox properties and continue to use them in other projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me for understanding the Flexbox. I really liked this source and will use it going forward.
